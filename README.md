# Totoro timer
A pomodoro app in C
### Introduction:
Francesco Cirillo created the Pomodoro Technique as a time-management technique in the late 1980s. It divides the task into intervals that are typically 25 minutes long and are separated by brief breaks using a kitchen timer.
The initial method consists of six steps:
1. Select the task to be completed.
2. Establish the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Complete the task.
4. Finish your task when the timer goes off and grab a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
5. If you have completed fewer than three Pomodoro, repeat Step 2 until you have completed all three.
6. After the third and fourth Pomodoro are finished, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). After the long break is finished return to step 2
### Explaining the project:
Totoro Time is a simple program to help you stay focused and productive by sequentially scheduling work and rest times. Traditionally, there are four straight 25-minute focus periods, five-minute breaks, and then a lengthier 30-minute rest. This program accurately applies the Pomodoro technique and indicates when to work and when to take a brief break. The fundamental features of this program are as follows:
1.	Select from the main menu whether you want to see about-us,start timer,see history or exit program.
2.	The about us section will print information related to the project.
3.	The timer section will allow user to choose between default,custom timer.
4.	If user selects default timer it will start 25 min work timer then 5 min short break timer and 30 min long break timer after four 25 min timer.
5.	If user selects custom timer it will ask user about the total no.of minutes and start the timer.
6.	The history section will display all the pomodoro and their duration in minutes,seconds.
