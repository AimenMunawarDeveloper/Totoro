# Totoro timer
A pomodoro app in C
### Introduction:
Francesco Cirillo created the Pomodoro Technique as a time-management technique in the late 1980s. It divides the task into intervals that are typically 25 minutes long and are separated by brief breaks using a kitchen timer.
The initial method consists of six steps:
* Select the task to be completed.
* Establish the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
* Complete the task.
* Finish your task when the timer goes off and grab a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).
* If you have completed fewer than three Pomodoro, repeat Step 2 until you have completed all three.
* After the third and fourth Pomodoro are finished, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). After the long break is finished return to step 2
### Explaining the project:
Totoro Time is a simple program to help you stay focused and productive by sequentially scheduling work and rest times. Traditionally, there are four straight 25-minute focus periods, five-minute breaks, and then a lengthier 30-minute rest. This program accurately applies the Pomodoro technique and indicates when to work and when to take a brief break. The fundamental features of this program are as follows:
* Select from the main menu whether you want to see about-us,start timer,see history or exit program.
* The about us section will print information related to the project.
* The timer section will allow user to choose between default,custom timer.
* If user selects default timer it will start 25 min work timer then 5 min short break timer and 30 min long break timer after four 25 min timer.
* If user selects custom timer it will ask user about the total no.of minutes and start the timer.
* The history section will display all the pomodoro and their duration in minutes,seconds.
